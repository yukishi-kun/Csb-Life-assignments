Title: What the HELL!

Dear LIFE,
	Nothing much has changed since yesterday except that my blockmates were more noisier than last time.
During my history I was paying attention in class like a good boy. Suddenly out of the blue a voice rings inside
my head saying "YOU SUCK!"... For some reason I smiled and creeped out the person beside me which was patch. She told me
why I was smiling so I replied, "I just remembered something funny." After our first subject and onto our second subject
which was compfun. I had a lot of fun with Alice while sir arjay (no offense to him) was babbling about this/that and how it works. 
When I made this awesome world about "PAUL's WORLD" there were too any idiotic movements in my "project".

	After a long day from Csb to my house; I went to sleep and shockingly I dream't about the voice that ringed inside my head.
The person who said you suck was actually a figment of my imagination and that's all that happened.

-This is P.A. logging off :D
