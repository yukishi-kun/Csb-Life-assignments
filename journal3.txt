Title: OH MY GASOLINE!

Dear LIFE,
	I forgot about the History Project to be submitted!!! OH NOES!!! What am I gonna do? I left it at home and it has no CD case.
Fortunately the deadline was postponed till next week so I'm safe! WEW! So after Bibstud me, ron, ysrael, and James went to this internet
cafe name I.T. Log and played Call Of Duty World at War. It was a hell lot of fun until we named the zombie kupal for no reason. I thought of 
a cool tactic in COD where you exploit the glitches... There were a lot of glitches in the game so it was more fun. After playing we lost track of
time and thought that we were gonna be late for Compfun. By the time we got to the lab we made it! And I thought we were safe until I saw our prof 
already seated on the front desk...
S**T!!!!!
	
	I have nothing to say in this journal except that from I got to repair my internet connection!. I was thinking maybe to make a
 Algeb-X reviewer so what the heck! I will try anyway. By the time I was at my house i had to find some sealant to try and seal the holes on the roof...
I'm never gonna do that again but it was fun though in the rain txting while applying epoxy steel on the roof.

-This is P.A. logging off :D
