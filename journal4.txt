Title: OH MY GASOLINE!

Dear LIFE,
	I was so not prepared for the PeonPf practical exam. I had trouble making my team mates cooperate
and help all of us to finish early. Miggy was not much of a help since he doesn't care anymore. During the
practical our coach sir Juan De La Cruz managed to grade 3 groups at a time. Talk about multitasking his eyes.
My group's final grade was 95 so I'm happy.

	I went to my assigned room for aesthetics and sat there waiting for something to happen. Nothing much 
happened so I watched what miggy was looking at. There was this grotesque video about Happy Tree Friends! and
I thought it was for kids. Until I saw blood and all those things from the body... Good thing our prof came just
in time cause I was stunned by the video. We watched this awesome video about niggers or something like that seeing
art through exotic lifestyle's. It wasn't boring and somehow interesting cause I got to learn that garbage can't be
recyled but recylable materials can. "Everyone" keeps saying that all they throw is garbage but to some it a unique
blessing in disguise. I don't want to think about any of this stuff about art made of trash etc... So that is all.

-This is P.A. signing off :D
