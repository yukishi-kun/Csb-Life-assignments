Title: SECURITY

Dear LIFE,
	I'm not supposed to be here in Caloocan but since my mother made me in-charge of all the security cam's
in her business. While scrolling through the dates this frickin slow DVR I managed or somehow I spotted a paranormal activity.
I was shocked to actually see one so now I'm very cautious about the area. After that scary footage that I backed up to my
pen drive I used the computer to try and play Dragon Nest which I got from a friend. The net keeps on disconnecting so I got
angry and stopped playing after 15 mins.

	My mom asked me to show her the footage of this paranormal activity and suprisingly the video footage of the mysteious appearance
disappeared into thin air. Wow! This is my first time to actually encounter this one but I didn't care that much anyway so I moved on without
thinking about that video.

-This is P.A. signing off :D
