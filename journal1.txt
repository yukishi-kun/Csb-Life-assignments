Title of Journal: I shall call my journal... LIFE because its about me :D

Dear LIFE,
	I had a wonderful time today. It was full of magic and mysterious wonders. 
At 7:30 A.M. I almost slept on a certain table on the 3rd Floor. Early 1:36 A.M. I recieved a jet lag.
While I was sleeping in my comfortable bed, every 30 minutes to 1 hour I wake up. I was having a good dream
and this jet lag broke it! My dream was... I forgot...

	Aside from that I was intrigued about revising my(almost finished) mock proposal for compfun. 
While I was working, chatting in facebook, and searching for models; I saw this rat inside my Pc's Base. It took
a crap many times inside. I found its smell as assertive because the scent was everywhere and the source is from the rats crap inside my PC... EW!!
I also saw this beetle when I stepped out; it smells like a... hm.... mystifying :D...

	When my driver picked me up from CSB... I can smell his "ASIM"!!! You know what I mean :)). I like the smell of onions.
It makes me cry and I love it cause it tastes GOOD. Compared to my driver... He smells more of a rotten onion and my reaction was... S****!

P.S. - You owe me 100 pesos for reading... JUST KIDDING!! =))
