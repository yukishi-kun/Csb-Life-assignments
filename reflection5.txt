	Reaction Paper for the FROSH ORIENTATION

I was pretty excited because my block and the GDD students will come to the Orientation but it seems it was a sort of repeat
from the March orientation I attended.  The differemce was though that the students were noisy, minding there own business
not giving a crap about the topic, although I did too because I still remember the March orientation.
